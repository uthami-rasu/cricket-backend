all files are under one root 'src'
k8s directory is for deployment manifest files
.gitlab-ci.yml is for Gitlab's CI/CID pipeline

=== For the first time.
Create migrations:
setup .sequelizerc file first.(see the file content for explanation.)

npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Sample --attributes name:string,description:string,pur_price:double,sale_price:double,pur_date:date,stock:integer
 
it will create one file under src/models/Sample.js with class naem Sample inside it.
in model file:

replace {
      sequelize,
      modelName: "Sample",
    } 
with 
{
      sequelize,
      modelName: "Sample",
      tableName: "samples", //table name always all small case
      timestamps: true,
      createdAt: "created_at",
      updatedAt: "modified_at",
}


it will create one migration file under src/migrations directory.
in all migration files check the 'table name' make it 'all small case' and with '_' if multiple word you want.

in all migration files:

replace 
createdAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
      updatedAt: {
        allowNull: false,
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      }
with 
created_at: {
        allowNull: false,
        defaultValue: Sequelize.literal("CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"),
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
      created_by: {
        allowNull: false,
        defaultValue: 1,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
      },
      modified_at: {
        allowNull: true,
        defaultValue: Sequelize.literal("NULL ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"),
        type: Sequelize.DATE,
      },
      modified_by: {
        allowNull: true,
        type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
      }

===
After doing the above changes only you should run the migration command:
==
Run migration:
to create tables only (not DB. DB should be there in place already.)
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate 
it will run all the migration files under src/migrations directory

to create some sample records initially.(seed records)
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all 
it will run all the seeder files under src/seeders directory

if you see in the DB:
you will find a new table called 'SequelizeMeta', it is used by sequelize for migrations management.
===

Run the applicatin:
in project root directory:
npm install
npm run dev
